# BioGrakn
A Knowledge Graph-based Semantic Database for Biomedical Sciences

&nbsp;

## Introduction

*BioGrakn* is a graph-based semantic database that takes advantage of the power of knowledge graphs and machine reasoning to solve problems in the domain of biomedical science.

*Biograkn* has been built on top of [GRAKN.AI](http://grakn.ai/), a distributed knowledge graph database which allows complex data modeling, verification, scaling, querying, and analysis.
